CS 165 - Project 2 - Testing Solution Quality

Project 2 involves testing various bin packing algorithms experimentally to determine the quality of the solutions they produce. The specific bin-packing algorithms you should implement are the following five algorithms:

1. Next Fit (NF)
2. First Fit (FF)
3. Best Fit (BF)
4. First Fit Decreasing (FFD)
5. Best Fit Decreasing (BFD)

For your implementations of First Fit and Best Fit (including the FFD and BFD versions), you must implement these methods to run in O(n log n) expected time. Moreover, your solutions must use a balanced binary search tree known as a zip tree and you must implement this data structure yourself, not from a library.
